Titanic ML Monitoring & Drift Detection
This project demonstrates an end-to-end Machine Learning monitoring system using the Titanic dataset. A Random Forest model is trained to predict passenger survival, and incoming data is continuously monitored for data drift using statistical techniques. A Streamlit dashboard provides real-time predictions and drift visualization.
